The primary purpose here is to establish a tools for image capture. There are 4 types, with different applications

# Video LiveStream Local Network
Live streaming within a local network from lightweight streaming hardware does not depend on bandwidth or data usage restrcitions to process on a single more-powerful machine. Allows for live monitoring on the local network.
Requires: Data access to a local network (router)
Example: cameras mounted on a police cruiser stream to on onboard PC that performs OCR on license plates and matches against known stolen vehicle database
Processing Mode: Live

# Video LiveStream Global  Network
When placing a processing system on-site creates challenges, this is a solution, but can incur large fees for data usage.  Allows for live monitoring from anywhere.
Requires: Data access to internet (preferably unlimited)
Processing Mode: Live
Example: Remote cameras connected to LTE/5G hotspots send live data

# Image Recording
Requires more storage space, but allows for file uploads for later. Typically better resolution than video
Processing Mode: Batch
Example: snap images of daily changes to understand entrances/exits from a particular place

# Video Recording
Requires more storage space, but allows for file uploads for later
Processing Mode: Batch
Example: record video of activity in a mail room to identify package theft



Of these, we can enable several tools to help reduce processing costs, for instance
# Motion detection
Pro: Reduces wasted ML attempts on useless images
Con: buffering increases time to process on camera device
